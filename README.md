here I have tried to do some neutronics 
1.(basically solving neutron diffusion equation under different conditions using 1 D and 2 D  for 1 group and 2 group neutrons).
As discritization process I have used FVM,FDM.I used SOR method as solver.
2.Tried to develop a monte carlo code for nuclear rocket engine



I have always admired and loved computers and maths.
doing this codes was supper fun for me.if you've got any advise,I will be happy to have that .
