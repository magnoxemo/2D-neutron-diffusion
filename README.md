here I have tried to do some neutronics (basically solving neutron diffusion equation under different conditions
using 1 D and 2 D  for 1 group and 2 group neutrons).As discritization process I have used FVM,FDM.
I used SOR method as solver.


I have always admired and loved computers and maths.
doing this codes was supper fun for me.if you've got any advise,I will be happy to have that .
